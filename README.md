# Cloudflare Worker with D1 Database

## Project Overview

This is a web application built with Cloudflare Workers and D1 Database. It provides a dashboard with data visualization features for tracking entries. The application consists of:

- Backend API endpoints served by Cloudflare Workers
- Frontend dashboard with charts (using Chart.js)
- D1 Database for data storage
- KV namespace for static content

The application follows a simple structure separating the backend Worker logic (src/index.js) from the frontend assets (src/pages/). The database operations are handled in db.js, while the main dashboard interface is in dashboard.html which includes Chart.js for data visualization and date range controls for filtering.

## Configuration Details

From our investigation, we've discovered the following configuration:

### D1 Database
- Database name: `entries-local` (local development)
- Database ID: `e7c4a4a6-7174-4a8c-9cfc-0f57b654d039`
- Contains an `entries` table that stores the application data

### KV Namespace
- Namespace: `STATIC_CONTENT`
- Used for serving static assets

### File Structure
- Main worker code: `src/index.js`
- Static assets: `src/pages/`
- Dashboard: `src/pages/dashboard.html`

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Wrangler CLI installed:
   ```
   npm install -g wrangler
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   wrangler dev --local --persist-to .wrangler/state
   ```

3. Access the dashboard at:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:8787/dashboard.html
   ```

4. For database operations, you can use the Wrangler D1 commands:
   ```
   wrangler d1 execute entries-local --command="SELECT * FROM entries LIMIT 5;"
   ```

## Current State

The application is partially functioning:

- ✅ Server is running on port 8787
- ✅ D1 database connection is working
- ✅ API endpoints are responding successfully
- ✅ Basic dashboard is loading
- ❌ Date range controls are not displaying properly
- ❌ Chart data may not be updating correctly

## Next Steps for Troubleshooting

To fix the date range controls issue, we need to:

1. Check frontend JavaScript:
   - Verify that the `timeRange` select element's change event is firing
   - Check that date initialization functions are working properly
   - Ensure Chart.js is properly initialized with data

2. Verify API endpoints receive correct date range parameters:
   - Check the `getDateParams()` function implementation
   - Verify that query parameters are correctly appended to API requests
   - Test API endpoints directly with date parameters to confirm functionality

3. Inspect the dashboard.html:
   - Confirm date range controls are properly structured
   - Check CSS styles to ensure they're not hiding elements unintentionally
   - Add console logging to debug the interaction between UI elements

After resolving these issues, the dashboard should be fully functional with working date range controls and proper data visualization.
